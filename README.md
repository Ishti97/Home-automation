# Possible Outcome

We will be able to manipulate light from far in this project. Android phones, laptops, and other
smart gadgets are examples. Let's pretend that someone neglected to turn off the light in his
room. However, the individual is no longer present in the room. In this situation, the individual
will be able to turn on or off the light using the Wi-Fi network as needed.

# Proposed system and architecture

The system's core principle is to control home over internet. The database will be stored in a
server along with the process. The system can be divided into its hardware and software
components. The hardware components consist of a Relay Module, ESP8266 connected with
lights, fans, electrical devices and power supply and a server which will wirelessly connect with
the ESP8266 and paired smartphones to send and receive data. The block diagram illustrates the
connections among the physical components.
The software components consist of the logic used in the Relay Module and ESP8266 to take
input and show the output specifically controlling the devices.
