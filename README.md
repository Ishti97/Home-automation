#Possible Outcome

We will be able to manipulate light from far in this project. Android phones, laptops, and other
smart gadgets are examples. Let's pretend that someone neglected to turn off the light in his
room. However, the individual is no longer present in the room. In this situation, the individual
will be able to turn on or off the light using the Wi-Fi network as needed.
